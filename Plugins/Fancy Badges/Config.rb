#  Fancy Badges
#    by Luka S.J.
#
#  Renders a 3D version of a badge, and applies rotational animation
#  to spice up those scenes when you obtain Gym Badges.
#  Call it in an event via the 'script' command using:
#      renderBadgeAnimation(X)
#  Where "X" represents the internal ID of the badge
#
#  Enjoy the script, and make sure to give credit!
